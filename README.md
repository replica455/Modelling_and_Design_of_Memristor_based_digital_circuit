# Introduction 

*  circuits built with semiconductor 
devices have provided significant growth in the number of processing elements and 
memory bits available to system developers. This growth has provided orders of 
magnitude improvements in speed, power consumption, and reliability, together with 
significant reductions in the cost per device
* These trends are direct consequences of 
frequent miniaturization of device dimensions in the semiconductor fabrication 
process, as originally described by Gordon Moore in 1965, predicting the growth and 
proliferation of digital computing and its applications ("Moore's Law")
* Moore's law, however, cannot be sustained indefinitely
* CMOS transistor sizes will reach fundamental physical limits within 
the next decade
* the field of computing is already struggling with other 
fundamental problems which require innovative solutions. The first problem is related 
to the delay and bandwidth required to access memory, and is popularly known as 
"the memory wall" 
* Another problem is the power crisis related to energy 
dissipation in computers 
* In future years, when device sizes will no longer be scalable, microelectronic 
technology will need innovations "beyond Moore" to support novel applications. 
* An example of a "more than Moore" 
technology is multi-layered integrated circuits (e.g., three-dimensional circuits
