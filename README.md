# Introduction 

*  circuits built with semiconductor 
devices have provided significant growth in the number of processing elements and 
memory bits available to system developers. This growth has provided orders of 
magnitude improvements in speed, power consumption, and reliability, together with 
significant reductions in the cost per device
* These trends are direct consequences of 
frequent miniaturization of device dimensions in the semiconductor fabrication 
process, as originally described by Gordon Moore in 1965, predicting the growth and 
proliferation of digital computing and its applications ("Moore's Law")
* Moore's law, however, cannot be sustained indefinitely
* CMOS transistor sizes will reach fundamental physical limits within 
the next decade
* the field of computing is already struggling with other 
fundamental problems which require innovative solutions. The first problem is related 
to the delay and bandwidth required to access memory, and is popularly known as 
"the memory wall" 
* Another problem is the power crisis related to energy 
dissipation in computers 
* In future years, when device sizes will no longer be scalable, microelectronic 
technology will need innovations "beyond Moore" to support novel applications. 
* An example of a "more than Moore" 
technology is multi-layered integrated circuits (e.g., three-dimensional circuits 
* Other new technologies which will 
extend the capabilities of CMOS are memristive devices. This thesis focuses on 
memristive technologies and their impact on computers.

# Memristor 
* Flash memory based on charge trapping in MOS transistors 
* Scaling below 20 nm 
involves formidable challenges, particularly an increase in bit error rate and a 
reduction in write endurance (the number of write cycles before the memory becomes 
unreliable).
* In recent years, many alternative technologies have been 
explored to find a replacement for flash. For most of these candidate technologies, the 
stored data is represented as a resistance and the storage device is fabricated within 
the metal layers.
* These technologies share similar properties – nonvolatility, relatively 
high write endurance, high density, good scalability below 10 nm, and fast read and 
write
```
These emerging nonvolatile memory technologies can be considered as memristors, or more precisely as memristive devices
